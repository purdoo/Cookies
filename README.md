# Cookies
A rankings survey of all the 2018 Girl Scout Cookies

## Introduction
I decided to survey coworkers and close friends to determine how different girl scout cookies stacked up against each other.

## Summary of Key Findings
Girl Scout cookies are pretty good. Also, the nice Girl Scout who I purchased my cookies accepted Venmo, which was nice. 

## Recommendations
Everyone can benefit from more Girl Scout cookies in their day-to-day life. Girl Scout cookies are strongly correlated with happiness, increased throughput, and an ability to scale a business.

## Detailed Findings
- Thin Mints, coming in as the consensus #1 cookie in preseason polls, were dethroned by Samoas but still finished with a respectable ranking.
- Gluten Free cookies aren't as bad as initially thought but are still garbage-tier.
- S'mores ranked near the bottom of both rankings as well as participation in terms of number of people sampling
- The two most divisive cookies (highest standard deviation) were Savannah Smiles and Samoas...two cookies with rather unique, and therefore, polarizing flavors.
- The two lease divisive cookies (lowest standard deviation) were Trefoils and ToffeeTastic (GF)...most likely because they are boring, uninspiring cookies that almost everyone can agree are meh.

## Methodology
I would approach individuals with several boxes of girl scout cookies and demand that they try some. Those who sampled cookies were asked to provide a rating from 1-10. Some individuals were harder to track down than others. Participants were instructed to provide these rankings relative to ALL cookies they have ever tried as opposed to simply rating relative to other Girl Scout cookies.

I would say it was a *double-blind* approach because the participant did not know in advance that they were going to be sampling cookies and the cookie didn't know it was being eaten. Stats!
